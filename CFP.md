# Call for Participation: Inclusive Web Devroom

<b>We invite you to submit a talk about anything that relates to making the Web a more inclusive space!</b>

Websites and the extended web technologies such as browsers, extensions, etc. are regularly used by everyone, but sometimes people can get left behind if a technology hasn't been designed in a way that is inclusive for _everyone_ and not just a specific group of people. We firmly believe in making the Web a more inclusive space and want to encourage others to do so as well. 

## Possible topics

Some possible topics to inspire your talk: 

- Web accessibility
- Privacy and Security 
- Performance
- Localization and Internationalization 
- Sustainability
- ... and more! Any other form of work being done to make a the Web more inclusive is welcome! 


Anyone who is working on any open-source assistive technologies, or building tools to enhance privacy or improve localization, or any other open-source public interest technology that makes the web more inclusive and helps focus on digital rights are welcome to submit a talk for this Devroom.

_Not sure if your talk is a good fit?_ We encourage you to submit it anyway!
