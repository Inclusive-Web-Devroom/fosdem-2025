# Call for Participation: Inclusive Web Devroom

<b>We invite you to submit a talk about anything that relates to making the Web a more inclusive space!</b>

Websites and the extended web technologies such as browsers, extensions, etc. are regularly used by everyone, but sometimes people can get left behind if a technology hasn't been designed in a way that is inclusive for _everyone_ and not just a specific group of people. We firmly believe in making the Web a more inclusive space and want to encourage others to do so as well. 

## Possible topics

Some possible topics to inspire your talk: 

- Web accessibility
- Privacy and Security 
- Performance
- Localization and Internationalization 
- Sustainability
- ... and more! Any other form of work being done to make a the Web more inclusive is welcome! 


Anyone who is working on any open-source assistive technologies, or building tools to enhance privacy or improve localization, or any other open-source public interest technology that makes the web more inclusive and helps focus on digital rights are welcome to submit a talk for this Devroom.

_Not sure if your talk is a good fit?_ We encourage you to submit it anyway!

## What is the talk format?

Few things to note about the talk format:
- All talks in-person, and recorded and live-streamed.
- The speaker will have the stage for 25 minutes in total, including questions from audience. It's up to the speaker(s) to decide how much time they want to leave for questions. We would encourage at least 5 minutes.
- Talks cannot be longer than 25 mins otherwise you get gently moved off ‘stage’.
