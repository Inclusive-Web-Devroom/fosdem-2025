# Inclusive Web Devroom, FOSDEM 2025

This repository is used for the planning of the [Inclusive Web devroom](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/inclusive-web/) in [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/). The Inclusive Web devroom is scheduled to be on **2nd February 2025, Sunday** in Brussels, Belgium. The talks from the track will also be livestreamed.

## Call for Proposal

We will be opening the Call for Proposal soon. The deadline for submitting a proposal will be **1st December, 2024**.

## How can I contribute?
- **Organizing:** We would love to have more help in the organizing team. Organizing a devroom does take a bit of effort, and any help that we can get is highly appreciated.
- **Submit a Talk:** We will be opening the Call for Proposal soon. If you are someone working on Open Source projects to make the Web more Inclusive, we would love to hear from you.
- **Spread the word:** This is the first time there is going to be an Inclusive Web devroom. I think it's a really important topic to be discussed in a conference like FOSDEM, so it would be great to spread the word to as many folks as possible.
